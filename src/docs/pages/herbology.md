# Herbology

While adventuring in the wild, an essential part of survival is knowing what remedies and toxins can be extracted from the local vegetation. Raw materials are prolific throughout the environment, including roots, leaves, fungus, moss, seeds and other natural remenants.

The basis of herbology functions very similarly to contemporary culinary skills. With no exposure or technique to accomplish ones end goal, the task at hand can seem daunting. But much like cooking, certain common pattern and techniques apply to the practice, which once understood and mastered, allows the herbologist to concoct unique 'flavors' expanding off of more structured recipes. 

An adventurers attention and care is of the utmost importance when concocting new recipes. However, once mastered, and of sufficient level of experience, and of course provided the proper ingredients are readily available, recipes can be quickly prepared with little or no oversight of the process. 

During recipe concoction, raw materials are prepared using an assortment of tools. Some materials require manipulation to prove effective or increase their potency. Seeds may need to be crushed. Roots may need to be peeled. 

Of course, an adventurer will need to acquire tools necessary to prepare their ingredients. Knives, pots, mortar & pestals, sieves and other similar equipment will all be critical to fulfill a diverse set of preparatory requirements. Much like battle equipment, not all accessories are created equal. Certain materials may cause an unsavory reaction to the concoction. A seasoned herbologist keeps a range of high-quality accessories made of various materials that serve to complement the recipe.

Prepared materials then are typically combined in a heated mixture, taking care to add the proper materials in their due time. Some steps may require vigorous stirring. Others may require rest to allow the ingredients to effectively steep. Certain phases may require intense heat, while delicate materials may require a cool-down period as not to burn them.

Recipes will give indicators to tell an adventurer their relative level of success. Liquids left on heat for too long will show evidence of boiling. Well heated elements may produce steam, while burning ingredients may put off smoke or turn an unsavory color. Simpler concoctions may have a greater threshold for error, while more advanced recipes require precision in execution.

And of course measurements and ingredient ratios are critical to a well concocted recipe. Too much of an ingredient can spoil a delicate balance of materials, while not enough may hinder its potency. 

Once completed, a concoction will bear a mark of the level of success with a rank. The accuracy of the ingredient ratios applied and the artfulness in preparing the concoction affect the ranking applied either positively or negatively. A lower ranked concotion will have a fractional level of effectiveness where it can be determined in a partial manner. 

Herbology is a skill that is widely practiced by many adventurers and civilians alike. Certain enthusiasts are eager to share their knowledge, while more experienced practitioners may guard their secrets carefully, perhaps even keeping their meticulously curated recipes under lock and key.
