# Metallurgy

Much like any world bound to the fundamental forces of the universe as we understand it, an adventurer's world is filled with ores and metals — and a heavy demand to complement them. Many of the tools and equipment necessary to survive rely on crafting such raw materials, ultimately affecting the properties of the byproduct. 

All raw materials come with innate properties which are suited well for a particular purpose, and ill-suited for others. But the years of civilizations past have shown that combining these resources into alloys can yield materials with extraordinary properties not possibly innate to the raw elements by themselves. 

The knowledge of this craft is widely known, but few possess a mastery of the subject. Experimentation requires access to available materials and large processing equipment — neither of which are cheap or easy to come by or maintain. This knowledge is highly valuable and extremely coveted, as it may yield items with truly unique properties and capabilities, providing advantage in civil engineering and military affairs.

While certain materials exist and are generally well known in the land of the adventurer, it is rumored that civilizations of distant past may have contained far more intimate knowledge of advanced and since lost knowledge of metallurgy. Perhaps somewhere out there is a record of some of those secrets waiting to be rediscovered.

### [Mining](#resource-mining)

Ores and metals require vast amounts of pressure to create, and even greater amounts to have fused those elements into existence. It is therefore enormously rare to be able to acquire such resources on the surface. While some may appear near ancient riverbeds or ravines, ores are primarily discovered in subterranean environments. 

Naturally occurring cavernous formations are plentiful, providing initial entrypoints to access these resources. However, many of these rare elements require deep tunneling through solid rock before they are ever discovered. Many caverns do remain undiscovered and uncharted, leaving very little common knowledge about the details of their depths. Only the bravest of souls ever dare venture into them, and even of those that do, very few ever survive the journey to report their findings. 

### [smelting](#smelting)

Once collected, ores can be heated to their melting points in a smelter, where they can be combined and molded into its final form. Successful combination of metals can result in an alloy that retains favorable properties of the individual elements. Once combined, certain alloys cannot be separated due to their averaged melting points. While experimentation is the best teacher, seeking competent advice before expending precious resources is recommended. 

Much like a culinary recipe, processes and material compositions can be recorded and shared. Certain alloys may be more forgiving to create than others. Once an alloy recipe is successfully discovered and reproduced, that recipe can be replicated by others given the proper time and equipment. Reproduction of that alloy by another may depend on the skill and experience of the metallurgist. Much like any other craft, all craftsman are not created equal, nor is the result of their crafstmanship.
