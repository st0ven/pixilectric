# Smithing

Gathering resources in an adventurer's world can be a difficult and dangerous task. However, even the bravest of adventurers who could collect all the resources the world has to offer would do so for naught without the skill of those who can assemble and manipulate those materials into usable tools and weaponry.

Smithing is the art of creating such implements out of a variety of materials. There are even specializations within the craft itself dealing with particular types of wares, ranging from garments, cookware & cutlery, and of course weaponry & armor.

### [Wares](#wares)

Smiths in their realms of specialization often have a collection of wares they have created for general sale. These selection of wares are typically fashioned from materials that are abundant to the surrounding area of that smith's establishment. 

It is not unheard of for smiths to hold a special selection of wares that are a part of their private collection which they may have acquired through trade, adventure, experimental, or otherwise forbidden by local or regional law. Private wares are typically priced appropriately for their rarity and demand.

### [Crafting](#crafting)

Smiths typically have access to facilities which allow them to create unique or specialized garments in their area of expertise. Often times what they lack are the resources to create such unique pieces for their general wares collection.

Smiths can often be persuaded, for a fair price, to construct a unique item from a provided cache of supplies. The resulting item is typically that of the smith's discretion, and the resulting quality of that item falling within a range of the capabilities inherent to that smith. A fortunate adventurer can score some surprisingly unique and helpful items by such means. As with any tale of reward also comes risk. An adventurer would be wise to hand over their valuable resources to a smith that is incapable of delivering to their expectations. Sometimes one can hear tales of great success and hilariously terrible outcomes from local gossip circles.

As with all things in an adventurer's world, the resulting item will bear a rank symbolizing the cunning of the craftsmanship, which ultimately affects that items inherent stats and properties. All the more reason to choose one's services wisely. A general tidbit of advice to all adventurers, appearances are not always what they seem, and the quality of a smith's wares is not always indicative by its asking price.
